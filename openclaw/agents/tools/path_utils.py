Path resolution utilities matching pi-mono's path-utils.ts

This module provides path resolution with macOS compatibility:
- Expand ~ and environment variables
- Resolve relative to cwd
- Handle macOS filename quirks (NFD, special quotes, AM/PM spaces)

Matches pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/path-utils.ts
