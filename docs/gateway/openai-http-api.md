# OpenAI Chat Completions (HTTP)

OpenClaw's Gateway can serve a small OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint.

This endpoint is **disabled by default**. Enable it in config first.

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- Same port as the Gateway (WS + HTTP multiplex): `http://<gateway-host>:<port>/v1/chat/completions`

Under the hood, requests are executed as a normal Gateway agent run (same codepath as `openclaw agent`), so routing/permissions/config match your Gateway.

## Implementation

The Python gateway implements this endpoint in `openclaw/gateway/http/chat_completions.py`. The handler parses the request, resolves the agent and session, and delegates to the agent runtime.

## `/v1/models` endpoint — gap note

> **Note:** The Python gateway does **not** currently implement a `GET /v1/models` endpoint. Some OpenAI-compatible clients (e.g. LiteLLM, Open WebUI) send a `GET /v1/models` request to enumerate available models before using the chat completions endpoint. If your tool requires `/v1/models`, it will receive a 404 from the Python gateway.
>
> Workaround: configure your client to skip the models listing step, or pin the model name directly. The `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint works without needing `/v1/models`.

## Authentication

Uses the Gateway auth configuration. Send a bearer token:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Notes:

- When `gateway.auth.mode="token"`, use `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).
- When `gateway.auth.mode="password"`, use `gateway.auth.password` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`).
- If `gateway.auth.rateLimit` is configured and too many auth failures occur, the endpoint returns `429` with `Retry-After`.

## Choosing an agent

No custom headers required: encode the agent id in the OpenAI `model` field:

- `model: "openclaw:<agentId>"` (example: `"openclaw:main"`, `"openclaw:beta"`)
- `model: "agent:<agentId>"` (alias)

Or target a specific OpenClaw agent by header:

- `x-openclaw-agent-id: <agentId>` (default: `main`)

Advanced:

- `x-openclaw-session-key: <sessionKey>` to fully control session routing.

## Enabling the endpoint

Set `gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled` to `true`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Disabling the endpoint

Set `gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled` to `false`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Session behavior

By default the endpoint is **stateless per request** (a new session key is generated each call).

If the request includes an OpenAI `user` string, the Gateway derives a stable session key from it, so repeated calls can share an agent session.

## Streaming (SSE)

Set `stream: true` to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE):

- `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
- Each event line is `data: <json>`
- Stream ends with `data: [DONE]`

## Examples

Non-streaming:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-openclaw-agent-id: main' \
  -d '{
    "model": "openclaw",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]
  }'
```

Streaming:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-openclaw-agent-id: main' \
  -d '{
    "model": "openclaw",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]
  }'
```
